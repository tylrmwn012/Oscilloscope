# OSCILLOSCOPE
Analog to Digital Project for Spring 2026
            Tyler Mowen
# Overview & Purpose
An oscilloscope is an electronic measurement instrument used to visualize electrical signals as a graph of voltage versus time. By sampling the signal and displaying its waveform allows engineers to observe characteristics such as amplitude, frequency, shape, phase, and signal distortion. This makes it useful for diagnosing circuit behavior, verifying designs, analyzing analog and digital signals, and troubleshooting unexpected behavior in electronic systems.
# Learning Outcomes
